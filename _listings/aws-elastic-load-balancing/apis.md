description: Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application
  traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. It enables you to achieve fault tolerance
  in your applications, seamlessly providing the required amount of load balancing
  capacity needed to route application traffic.Elastic Load Balancing offers two types
  of load balancers that both feature high availability, automatic scaling, and robust
  security. These include theClassic Load Balancerthat routes traffic based on either
  application or network level information, and theApplication Load Balancerthat routes
  traffic based on advanced application level information that includes the content
  of the request. The Classic Load Balancer is ideal for simple load balancing of
  traffic across multiple EC2 instances, while the Application Load Balancer is ideal
  for applications needing advanced routing capabilities, microservices, and container-based
  architectures. Application Load Balancer offers ability to route traffic to multiple
  services or load balance across multiple ports on the same EC2 instance.
