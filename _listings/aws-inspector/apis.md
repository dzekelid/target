description: Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps
  improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector
  automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best
  practices. After performing an assessment, Amazon Inspector produces a detailed
  list of security findings prioritized by level of severity.To help you get started
  quickly, Amazon Inspector includes a knowledge base of hundreds of rules mapped
  to common security best practices and vulnerability definitions. Examples of built-in
  rules include checking for remote root login being enabled, or vulnerable software
  versions installed. These rules are regularly updated by AWS security researchers.
